# A-Flask-Web-App-for-automatic-text-summarization-using-SBERT
We will build a Flask web app that can input any long piece of information such as a blog or news article and summarize it into just five lines! Text summarization is an NLP(Natural Language Processing) task. SBERT(Sentence-BERT) has been used to achieve the same.
